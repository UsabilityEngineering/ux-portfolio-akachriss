# Design and New Ideas

Christopher Robles 03/09/2023

One of my main goals has been to truly understand parts of the design process before a product is developed. This experience has been full of different appraoches and steps but one of the most important ones in my opinion is **heuristic analysis**. A personal experience using a technology to accomplish a particular goal is everyday. I use my coffee maker to make coffee for myself every morning. In doing this, it's very easy to navigate the options due to it's recognition rather than recall design. This makes it very **memorable** and **error tolerant**. Some weaknesses with this although is lack of functionality. With easier designs, they tend to have less options to offer. In my case, I only like simple coffee so it's easy to naviagate and accomplish my goal. 

It's cool being able to use this tool outside of the class. I find it a great skill to practice to better understand the quality of the product you're using/looking at.
